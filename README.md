# Menger Sponge

This implementation quickly generates an L4 Menger sponge **using only 984 vertices!!!!** It does this by using planes and textures that represent the different layers of the sponge.

Explore the Menger Sponge fractal.  This utulizes the **Babylon.js** framework to create a menger sponge. It is a three-dimensional generalization of the one-dimensional Cantor set and two-dimensional Sierpinski carpet.
